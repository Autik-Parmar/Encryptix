                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p> Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a
                    businessman and investor known for his key roles in
                    space
                    company SpaceX and automotive company Tesla, Inc. Other
                    involvements include ownership of X Corp., formerly
                    Twitter,
                    and his role in the founding of The Boring Company, xAI,
                    Neuralink and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest people
                    in
                    the world; as of July 2024, Forbes estimates his net
                    worth
                    to be US$221 billion.</p>
                <p>

                    Musk was born in Pretoria to model Maye and businessman and
                    politician Errol Musk, and briefly attended the University
                    of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18,
                    acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two
                    years later, he matriculated at Queen's University at
                    Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University
                    of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics
                    and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend
                    Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and,
                    with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide
                    software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq
                    for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded
                    X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to
                    form PayPal. In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5
                    billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the
                    sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services
                    company, in 2002.

                    In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the
                    initial financing in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla
                    Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of
                    the company's chairman. He later became the product
                    architect, and in 2008 the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create
                    SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla
                    in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a
                    hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In
                    2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial
                    intelligence research company. The following year, Musk
                    co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing
                    brain–computer interfaces—and The Boring Company, a tunnel
                    construction company. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and
                    Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had
                    falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private
                    takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as
                    the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022,
                    he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged
                    the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the
                    service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded
                    xAI, an artificial intelligence company.</p>

                <h2>Achievements</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>He read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica at nine
                            years old</b><br>
                        Musk was an avid reader from a very young age. He would
                        spend, on average, 10 hours a day reading science
                        fiction novels and anything else he could get his hands
                        on. In fact, at the age of nine, he ran out of books to
                        read at the library, so he ended up reading the entire
                        Encyclopaedia Britannica before he finished fourth
                        grade.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>He taught himself to programme in three
                            days</b><br>Musk’s interest in technology started
                        evolving when he was 10 years old. Determined to teach
                        himself more about programming, he learned the BASIC
                        language after finishing a six-month course within just
                        three days. His efforts were not in vain, either: at 12
                        years old, he managed to create his own video game and
                        sell its code for the respectable amount of $500.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>He landed his first internship with a cold-call
                        </b><br>While in college, Musk made a habit of calling
                        executives he read about in magazines and asking them to
                        meet for lunch. Indeed, this bold stunt landed him his
                        very first internship at the Bank of Nova Scotia. His
                        experience there was particularly useful, as years later
                        he would go on to launch his own online finance
                        business.</li>
                    <li><b> He sold his first company for $307 million</b><br>On
                        his first bid to make a break in the internet industry,
                        Musk collaborated with his brother Kimbal to start their
                        own company, Zip2. It wasn’t long before their startup
                        was sold to a bigger company for a whopping $307
                        million. This transaction landed Musk with $22 million –
                        not too bad for a 27-year-old!</li>

                        exploration, renewable energy, and artificial

                        persistence and resilience in the face of numerous
                        challenges and failures. He has faced multiple setbacks

                        ideas. He is constantly pushing the boundaries of what

                        into his ventures, even when the outcomes were
                        uncertain. This risk-taking has often paid off, leading
                        to major breakthroughs.</li>

                        the details of his projects. This dedication inspires
                        his teams and drives his companies forward.</li>
